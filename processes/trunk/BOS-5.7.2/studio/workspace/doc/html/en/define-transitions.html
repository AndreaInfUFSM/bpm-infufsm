<p>In Bonita Studio, transitions represent sequence flow.</p>

<p>Transition arrows are used to connect all objects, allowing the sequence
flow to move from the start to the end of a process. In addition to connecting
elements in a process, transitions are used to define the direction of flow
between these elements.</p>

<p>If a transition is not present between process elements, the sequence flow
will stop. The flow is broken and the process will not reach its
termination.</p>

<p>Sequence flow must start and end within a single process. Transitions cannot
cross from one pool to another.</p>

<p>You can draw a transition between elements in a pool in two ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>using the design palette, or</li>
  <li>using the context palette on an element.</li>
</ul>
