<p>A multi-page form can be added to a pool, or to any human task in a process.
</p>

<p>Go to Bonita Studio, select the pool or human task. Add a form. Each form
that you add in the same way, in the same step or pool, becomes another page in
the single, multipage form associated with this step or pool. </p>

<p>When you add pages after the first one, each will contain a “previous”
and a “submit” button. Be sure to change the “submit” buttons to
“next” in all forms except the last one. (When the user clicks on a submit
button, the step is completed and the data in the form is saved into the Bonita
database.) </p>

<p>Navigate between multiple pages of a form using the "Previous Form" and
"Next Form" arrows at the top of the Form Builder grid on the whiteboard. By
default, the order of the pages is determined by the order they are listed
here. Change the order of the pages by using the "Up" and "Down" buttons. You
can also define the order of pages dynamically.</p>
