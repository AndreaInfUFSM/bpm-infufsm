<p>Use actor selectors to assign one or more actors / end users to perform
steps in a process. </p>

<p>Actor selectors are provided at the diagram and pool (i.e., global) level.
Here you will choose the type of actor selector that you want to create, give
it a name, and define the path/action it will use to fetch the actors during
execution of the task. </p>

<p>You can create actor selectors at the task level also. Any actor selectors
created inside a task will show up in the actor selectors list at the diagram
and pool level. </p>

<p>Actor selectors are grouped into 3 categories :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bonita: most of these will retrieve a list of actors as defined in Bonita
    User Experience, i.e.: Users, roles, groups, delegees, managers, team
    members</li>
  <li>Database: these will retrieve a list of actors from external
  databases</li>
  <li>LDAP: this will retrieve a list of actors from an LDAP directory</li>
</ul>
