<p>You can draw a transition between elements in a pool in two ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using the design palette: To create a transition between two unconnected
    elements, click on the transition icon in the design palette and drag and
    drop it into place.</li>
  <li>Using the context menu on an element:. When an element is created from
    another element using the context palette, a transition is created
    automatically.</li>
</ul>

<p>After transitions have been drawn to indicate direction of flow between
process elements, and when there is more than one possible path for the process
flow to take, transitions can be given conditions (or labeled as default) to
direct process flow. </p>
