<p>Text annotation is one of the standard artifacts in BPMN. It is used to
write extra information and explanations about elements in a process, but it
does not effect its execution.</p>

<p>Text annotation is useful for the process designer:</p>
<ul>
  <li>to explain more about what is going on generally in a process</li>
  <li>to clarify how to perform tasks in a process</li>
  <li>to defineterminologies etc. as additional information, which will be
    helpful to others involved in the process design</li>
</ul>

<p>Text annotations are basically labels. There are two ways to create a text
annotation :</p>
<ul>
  <li>from the design palette - this creates a free-floating annotation that
    can be placed anywhere on the pool</li>
  <li>from the context palette - this creates an annotation attached by a
    thread to its parent element</li>
</ul>

<p>Either action creates a box for annotated text that is displayed on the
whiteboard. You can then enter text into the annotation. The box itself can be
enlarged, and moved around on the pool, by clicking and dragging. You can add
annotated text boxes to whiteboard elements by clicking and dragging the text
annotation icon that appears in the context palette for the element.</p>
