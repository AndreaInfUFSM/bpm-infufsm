<p>The confirmation message can be shown whenever a series of forms is
completed by an end user, and a process case moves on to the next task(s),
performed by another end user. That is, at the end of a sequence of tasks/steps
performed by one end user, a confirmation message is shown and the subsequent
step shows up ready for the next user.</p>

<p>This is what the user would see on submission of the final page of a form
(for example, "thank you for your order").</p>
