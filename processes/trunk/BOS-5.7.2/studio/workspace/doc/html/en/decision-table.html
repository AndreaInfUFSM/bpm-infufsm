<h1>Use a decision table to define a condition</h1>

<p>A condition on a transition is evaluated by the Bonita Execution Engine to
determine whether the transition path is taken or not taken. Transition
conditions can be defined using a decision table. In the table, a series of
rows are defined, each of which is evaluated to apply a take or don't take
decision.</p>

<p>It is possible to have multiple conditions. Each condition has its own
row.</p>

<p>Each row in the table decision defines a condition where variables are
compared. If the condition is met (that is, evaluated to "true"), the indicated
decision will be taken. If it is evaluated to "false", the next row in the
table will be evaluated. If its condition is met, its indicated decision will
be taken.</p>

<p>The first row in the decision table to meet its condition will "make" the
decision. The transition will be taken (or not taken) according to the Decision
and the action is completed.</p>

<p>If none of the conditions in the rows in the decision table are met, then
the default decision will be taken.</p>
