<p>“Messages” have a definition specific to BPMN - these are not messages
sent by email or chat. (To send email, see email connectors).</p>

<p>Message events are used in a process to carry information from one process
to another (since transitions / process flow cannot cross process boundaries in
BPMN). Messages cannot be sent within a process – only between processes.</p>

<p>Messages are useful to synchronize two processes, and can also be used to
correlate two process instances.</p>

<p>Messages are unique; that is, a single message is sent and a target can
receive a single message. (To send information to multiple receivers at once,
or within a pool, use signals.)</p>

<p>Messages require configuration called <em>data mapping</em> between the
message sent and the message received in the different processes involved. Data
mapping can also include configuration of message correlation. </p>

<p>There are five types of message events: <strong>throw message, catch
message, start message, end message, </strong>and<strong>boundary
message</strong>.</p>

<p>There are two ways to add messages to a process design in Bonita Studio:</p>
<ul>
  <li>using drag and drop from the design palette</li>
  <li>drag and drop via the context palette on an element</li>
</ul>
