<p>The graphic interface (the whiteboard) of Bonita Studio allows you to draw
processes directly using notation consistent with standard Business Process
Modeling Notation (BPMN: <a href="http://www.bpmn.org/"
target="_parent">www.bpmn.org</a>). Behind the graphic interface is the Bonita
Execution Engine that connects processes to your existing systems and
deploys/runs the process. Thus, this graphic interface is connected directly to
the execution engine.</p>

<p>On the whiteboard, you can draw one or more process diagrams. Each process
diagram can contain one or more pools. Saving a diagram saves all the pools as
individual Bonita ARchive files, which can be deployed together or
separately.</p>

<p>Each pool in a process diagram is a complete process. When the pool(s) in a
process diagram are fully defined and configured, you can test-run them in your
development environment with the Run button.</p>
