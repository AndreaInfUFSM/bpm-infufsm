<h1>Run a process</h1>

<p>To run a process from inside Bonita Studio is one means to "execute" it - in
a development environment, to be used for testing as you develop a process. It
does not deploy a process in a production environment.</p>

<p>Before a process can be run, all its parameters (dependencies) must be
defined and keyed, an organization must be defined, and actors must be defined
and mapped to the organization.</p>

<p>When you select <em>Run</em> from Bonita Studio, the process is executed
with the default web application(s) packaged with Bonita Open Solution.</p>

<p>Clicking on the Run button "installs" the process on a test application
server (Jetty by default). This action deletes all previous instances of the
process and thereby should be used for tests only.</p>

<p>What happens, essentially, behind the <strong>Run</strong> button:</p>

<p>The process and its resources are packaged in a *.bar (Bonita ARchive)
file</p>
<ul>
  <li>A default Web application specific to the configuration of forms,
    templates, etc in this process is created</li>
  <li>The Bonita Execution Engine and a lightweight relational database
    (Hibernate) are launched by the application</li>
  <li>A web container (Jetty) is started and the *.war file deployed</li>
  <li>A new browser window opens and the first application page (instantiation
    form) is presented</li>
</ul>

<p>When a process has been run/executed, it can be instantiated again from
Bonita User Experience - still in a development environment</p>
