<p>Messages are used in a process to carry information from one process (pool)
to another. Messages are unique; that is, a single message is sent and a target
can receive a single message. This is useful to synchronize two processes, for
example.</p>

<p>This is a definition specific to BPMN - these are not messages sent by email
or chat. (To send email, see email connectors). Since transitions / process
flow cannot cross process boundaries in BPMN, messages are used to carry
information such as data from one process to another. This requires
configuration called data mapping between the processes involved.</p>

<p>Messages cannot be sent within a pool â€“ only between pools. To send
information to multiple receivers at once, or within a pool, use signals.</p>

<p>There five types of message events: </p>
<ul>
  <li>start message</li>
  <li>throw message</li>
  <li>catch message</li>
  <li>boundary message</li>
  <li>end message</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two ways to add messages to a process design in Bonita Studio :</p>
<ul>
  <li>using drag and drop from the design palette</li>
  <li>drag and drop via the context palette on an element</li>
</ul>
