<p>Connectors can be added to an individual task, or to the process level (that
is, to a pool). The configuration options are slightly different, but generally
similar. The first configuration wizard asks for the same type of information
for any connector.</p>

<p>To add a connector provided in Bonita Open Solution to a task or to a pool,
click on the task or pool and go to its Details pane. Them, under the general
tab, click on the connectors pane. Click on <em>Add</em>. </p>

<p>Note: you will need to have global variables defined, to associate with your
inputs and/or output results.</p>

<p>When the “Select a connector” wizard appears, choose the type of
connector you want to add. These connectors are each described in their
specific sections of the documentation, but all of them go through the same
first steps.</p>

<p>When you have completed these first two wizards to add a connector, the next
wizards are presented to define the specific parameters required for each
connector's inputs and, where appropriate, for its outputs. </p>
