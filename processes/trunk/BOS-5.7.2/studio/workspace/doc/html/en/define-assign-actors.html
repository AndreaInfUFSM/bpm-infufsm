<p>The term <em>actor</em> in Bonita Open Solution is defined as a subset or
part of the organization defined for a process. An actor represents a group of
individuals authorized or assigned to perform specific tasks in the process.
When the process is deployed, one or more individuals will then be assigned a
step to complete.</p>

<p>There are three required steps to completely define actor selection and
assignment:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Define the actor</li>
  <li>Assign the actor to a lane and [optionally] change the actor for a
    specific task(s) in a lane</li>
  <li>Map the actor to the organization</li>
</ol>

<p>Define actors at the process (pool) level, and then assign them to lanes
and/or tasks. A lane or task can have only a single actor.</p>
