<p>A form of one or more pages can be added to a pool or to any human task in a
process. You can add three type of forms at the pool level :</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Entry forms</strong> (called entry pageflow) allow data entry by
    the end user.Â </li>
  <li><strong>View forms</strong> (called view pageflow) and </li>
  <li><strong>Overview forms</strong> show data already entered; they can not
    be modified (available only in User XP Case History or via a Process Web
    app URL). They are generally used by the Process administrator, but they
    are added to your process in the same way as entry forms.</li>
</ul>

<p>At the task level, you can add <strong>Entry</strong> and
<strong>View</strong> forms only.</p>

<p>Generally, it is a good design practice to have your <strong>process and
step variables</strong> already defined before beginning form design.</p>
