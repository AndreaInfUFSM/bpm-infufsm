<p>Bonita Open Solution provides connectors to connect a task (activity) or a
process (pool) to external information systems. Connectors take specified input
(directly as a value from the end user or carried over / built into an
expression) and execute Java code. Some connectors also return output back into
Bonita Open Solution. </p>

<p>There are two ways to configure connectors :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add a connector – choose a connector already defined in Bonita Open
    Solution</li>
  <li>Create a connector – Create a new connector type; place it in an
    existing Bonita Open Solution category; use this as a wizard for future
    connectors of the same type</li>
</ul>

<p>Once created, connectors can be moved or copied (to another task or to a
process / pool). There is also a function to test or disconnect a connector
before the process is run in development mode.</p>
